    * Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.
    * Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection)).

### Data privacy

To protect sensitive data from potential leaks or unauthorized access, it is crucial to sandbox the model execution. This means running the model in a secure, isolated environment, which helps mitigate many attack vectors.

### Untrusted environments or networks

If you can't run your models in a secure and isolated environment or if it must be exposed to an untrusted network, make sure to take the following security precautions:
* Do not use the RPC backend, [rpc-server](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/rpc) and [llama-server](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/server) functionality (see https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13061).
* Confirm the hash of any downloaded artifact (e.g. pre-trained model weights) matches a known-good value.
* Encrypt your data if sending it over the network.

### Multi-Tenant environments

If you intend to run multiple models in parallel with shared memory, it is your responsibility to ensure the models do not interact or access each other's data. The primary areas of concern are tenant isolation, resource allocation, model sharing and hardware attacks.

1. Tenant Isolation: Models should run separately with strong isolation methods to prevent unwanted data access. Separating networks is crucial for isolation, as it prevents unauthorized access to data or models and malicious users from sending graphs to execute under another tenant's identity.

2. Resource Allocation: A denial of service caused by one model can impact the overall system health. Implement safeguards like rate limits, access controls, and health monitoring.

3. Model Sharing: In a multitenant model sharing design, tenants and users must understand the security risks of running code provided by others. Since there are no reliable methods to detect malicious models, sandboxing the model execution is the recommended approach to mitigate the risk.

4. Hardware Attacks: GPUs or TPUs can also be attacked. [Researches](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gpu+side+channel) has shown that side channel attacks on GPUs are possible, which can make data leak from other models or processes running on the same system at the same time.

Creating a release
==================

This document is documentation intended for maintainers of InputLeap.
It documents the release process of InputLeap.

Step 1: Setup environment variables
-----------------------------------

Setup the following environment variable that will be used throughout the rest of the steps.

    export VERSION=X.Y.Z

Step 2: Release notes PR
------------------------

Open a new branch (e.g. `release`) and run the following:

    towncrier build --version ${VERSION} --date `date -u  +%F`

This collects the release notes using the `towncrier` tool. Please commit the collected release
notes afterwards.

Certain file names are not properly supported by the `towncrier` tool and it ignores them.
Check `newsfragments` directory for any forgotten release notes

Step 3: Merge the release notes PR
----------------------------------

Step 4: Bump the version number
-------------------------------

Pull the merge commit created on the `master` branch during the step 2.

Edit the following files and update the version numbers:

 - `cmake/Version.cmake`
 - `doc/input-leapc.1`
 - `doc/input-leaps.1`
 - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`
 - `dist/debian/changelog`

Commit to the release branch with the following message `InputLeap x.y.z`.

Create a tag:

    git tag -s v${VERSION} -m v${VERSION}

Push the commit:

    git push origin master v${VERSION}

Step 5: Draft a new release on Github
-------------------------------------

Go to https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap/releases and draft a new release.

Use git tag as the title of the release: `vX.Y.Z`.

Use the release notes generated by the `towncrier` tool as the description of the releases.

Upload the artifacts created by Github Actions as the binaries of the release.
See dist/scripts/download_release.py for details.

# Assertions Reference

This page lists the assertion macros provided by GoogleTest for verifying code
behavior. To use them, include the header `gtest/gtest.h`.

The majority of the macros listed below come as a pair with an `EXPECT_` variant
and an `ASSERT_` variant. Upon failure, `EXPECT_` macros generate nonfatal
failures and allow the current function to continue running, while `ASSERT_`
macros generate fatal failures and abort the current function.

All assertion macros support streaming a custom failure message into them with
the `<<` operator, for example:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(my_condition) << "My condition is not true";
```

Anything that can be streamed to an `ostream` can be streamed to an assertion
macro—in particular, C strings and string objects. If a wide string (`wchar_t*`,
`TCHAR*` in `UNICODE` mode on Windows, or `std::wstring`) is streamed to an
assertion, it will be translated to UTF-8 when printed.

## Explicit Success and Failure {#success-failure}

The assertions in this section generate a success or failure directly instead of
testing a value or expression. These are useful when control flow, rather than a
Boolean expression, determines the test's success or failure, as shown by the
following example:

```c++
switch(expression) {
  case 1:
    ... some checks ...
  case 2:
    ... some other checks ...
  default:
    FAIL() << "We shouldn't get here.";
}
```

### SUCCEED {#SUCCEED}

`SUCCEED()`

Generates a success. This *does not* make the overall test succeed. A test is
considered successful only if none of its assertions fail during its execution.

The `SUCCEED` assertion is purely documentary and currently doesn't generate any
user-visible output. However, we may add `SUCCEED` messages to GoogleTest output
in the future.

### FAIL {#FAIL}

`FAIL()`

Generates a fatal failure, which returns from the current function.

Can only be used in functions that return `void`. See
[Assertion Placement](../advanced.md#assertion-placement) for more information.

### ADD_FAILURE {#ADD_FAILURE}

`ADD_FAILURE()`

Generates a nonfatal failure, which allows the current function to continue
running.

### ADD_FAILURE_AT {#ADD_FAILURE_AT}

`ADD_FAILURE_AT(`*`file_path`*`,`*`line_number`*`)`

Generates a nonfatal failure at the file and line number specified.

## Generalized Assertion {#generalized}

The following assertion allows [matchers](matchers.md) to be used to verify
values.

### EXPECT_THAT {#EXPECT_THAT}

`EXPECT_THAT(`*`value`*`,`*`matcher`*`)` \
`ASSERT_THAT(`*`value`*`,`*`matcher`*`)`

Verifies that *`value`* matches the [matcher](matchers.md) *`matcher`*.

For example, the following code verifies that the string `value1` starts with
`"Hello"`, `value2` matches a regular expression, and `value3` is between 5 and
10:

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"

using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;
using ::testing::StartsWith;

...
EXPECT_THAT(value1, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(value2, MatchesRegex("Line \\d+"));
ASSERT_THAT(value3, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
```

Matchers enable assertions of this form to read like English and generate
informative failure messages. For example, if the above assertion on `value1`
fails, the resulting message will be similar to the following:

```
Value of: value1
  Actual: "Hi, world!"
Expected: starts with "Hello"
```

GoogleTest provides a built-in library of matchers—see the
[Matchers Reference](matchers.md). It is also possible to write your own
matchers—see [Writing New Matchers Quickly](../gmock_cook_book.md#NewMatchers).
The use of matchers makes `EXPECT_THAT` a powerful, extensible assertion.

*The idea for this assertion was borrowed from Joe Walnes' Hamcrest project,
which adds `assertThat()` to JUnit.*

## Boolean Conditions {#boolean}

The following assertions test Boolean conditions.

### EXPECT_TRUE {#EXPECT_TRUE}

`EXPECT_TRUE(`*`condition`*`)` \
`ASSERT_TRUE(`*`condition`*`)`

Verifies that *`condition`* is true.

### EXPECT_FALSE {#EXPECT_FALSE}

`EXPECT_FALSE(`*`condition`*`)` \
`ASSERT_FALSE(`*`condition`*`)`

Verifies that *`condition`* is false.

## Binary Comparison {#binary-comparison}

The following assertions compare two values. The value arguments must be
comparable by the assertion's comparison operator, otherwise a compiler error
will result.

If an argument supports the `<<` operator, it will be called to print the
argument when the assertion fails. Otherwise, GoogleTest will attempt to print
them in the best way it can—see
[Teaching GoogleTest How to Print Your Values](../advanced.md#teaching-googletest-how-to-print-your-values).

Arguments are always evaluated exactly once, so it's OK for the arguments to
have side effects. However, the argument evaluation order is undefined and
programs should not depend on any particular argument evaluation order.

These assertions work with both narrow and wide string objects (`string` and
`wstring`).

See also the [Floating-Point Comparison](#floating-point) assertions to compare
floating-point numbers and avoid problems caused by rounding.

### EXPECT_EQ {#EXPECT_EQ}

`EXPECT_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`==`*`val2`*.

Does pointer equality on pointers. If used on two C strings, it tests if they
are in the same memory location, not if they have the same value. Use
[`EXPECT_STREQ`](#EXPECT_STREQ) to compare C strings (e.g. `const char*`) by
value.

When comparing a pointer to `NULL`, use `EXPECT_EQ(`*`ptr`*`, nullptr)` instead
of `EXPECT_EQ(`*`ptr`*`, NULL)`.

### EXPECT_NE {#EXPECT_NE}

`EXPECT_NE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_NE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`!=`*`val2`*.

Does pointer equality on pointers. If used on two C strings, it tests if they
are in different memory locations, not if they have different values. Use
[`EXPECT_STRNE`](#EXPECT_STRNE) to compare C strings (e.g. `const char*`) by
value.

When comparing a pointer to `NULL`, use `EXPECT_NE(`*`ptr`*`, nullptr)` instead
of `EXPECT_NE(`*`ptr`*`, NULL)`.

### EXPECT_LT {#EXPECT_LT}

`EXPECT_LT(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_LT(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`<`*`val2`*.

### EXPECT_LE {#EXPECT_LE}

`EXPECT_LE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_LE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`<=`*`val2`*.

### EXPECT_GT {#EXPECT_GT}

`EXPECT_GT(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_GT(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`>`*`val2`*.

### EXPECT_GE {#EXPECT_GE}

`EXPECT_GE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_GE(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that *`val1`*`>=`*`val2`*.

## String Comparison {#c-strings}

The following assertions compare two **C strings**. To compare two `string`
objects, use [`EXPECT_EQ`](#EXPECT_EQ) or [`EXPECT_NE`](#EXPECT_NE) instead.

These assertions also accept wide C strings (`wchar_t*`). If a comparison of two
wide strings fails, their values will be printed as UTF-8 narrow strings.

To compare a C string with `NULL`, use `EXPECT_EQ(`*`c_string`*`, nullptr)` or
`EXPECT_NE(`*`c_string`*`, nullptr)`.

### EXPECT_STREQ {#EXPECT_STREQ}

`EXPECT_STREQ(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_STREQ(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)`

Verifies that the two C strings *`str1`* and *`str2`* have the same contents.

### EXPECT_STRNE {#EXPECT_STRNE}

`EXPECT_STRNE(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_STRNE(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)`

Verifies that the two C strings *`str1`* and *`str2`* have different contents.

### EXPECT_STRCASEEQ {#EXPECT_STRCASEEQ}

`EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_STRCASEEQ(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)`

Verifies that the two C strings *`str1`* and *`str2`* have the same contents,
ignoring case.

### EXPECT_STRCASENE {#EXPECT_STRCASENE}

`EXPECT_STRCASENE(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_STRCASENE(`*`str1`*`,`*`str2`*`)`

Verifies that the two C strings *`str1`* and *`str2`* have different contents,
ignoring case.

## Floating-Point Comparison {#floating-point}

The following assertions compare two floating-point values.

Due to rounding errors, it is very unlikely that two floating-point values will
match exactly, so `EXPECT_EQ` is not suitable. In general, for floating-point
comparison to make sense, the user needs to carefully choose the error bound.

GoogleTest also provides assertions that use a default error bound based on
Units in the Last Place (ULPs). To learn more about ULPs, see the article
[Comparing Floating Point Numbers](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/).

### EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ {#EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ}

`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that the two `float` values *`val1`* and *`val2`* are approximately
equal, to within 4 ULPs from each other.

### EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ {#EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ}

`EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)`

Verifies that the two `double` values *`val1`* and *`val2`* are approximately
equal, to within 4 ULPs from each other.

### EXPECT_NEAR {#EXPECT_NEAR}

`EXPECT_NEAR(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`abs_error`*`)` \
`ASSERT_NEAR(`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`abs_error`*`)`

Verifies that the difference between *`val1`* and *`val2`* does not exceed the
absolute error bound *`abs_error`*.

## Exception Assertions {#exceptions}

The following assertions verify that a piece of code throws, or does not throw,
an exception. Usage requires exceptions to be enabled in the build environment.

Note that the piece of code under test can be a compound statement, for example:

```cpp
EXPECT_NO_THROW({
  int n = 5;
  DoSomething(&n);
});
```

### EXPECT_THROW {#EXPECT_THROW}

`EXPECT_THROW(`*`statement`*`,`*`exception_type`*`)` \
`ASSERT_THROW(`*`statement`*`,`*`exception_type`*`)`

Verifies that *`statement`* throws an exception of type *`exception_type`*.

### EXPECT_ANY_THROW {#EXPECT_ANY_THROW}

`EXPECT_ANY_THROW(`*`statement`*`)` \
`ASSERT_ANY_THROW(`*`statement`*`)`

Verifies that *`statement`* throws an exception of any type.

### EXPECT_NO_THROW {#EXPECT_NO_THROW}

`EXPECT_NO_THROW(`*`statement`*`)` \
`ASSERT_NO_THROW(`*`statement`*`)`

Verifies that *`statement`* does not throw any exception.

## Predicate Assertions {#predicates}

The following assertions enable more complex predicates to be verified while
printing a more clear failure message than if `EXPECT_TRUE` were used alone.

### EXPECT_PRED* {#EXPECT_PRED}

`EXPECT_PRED1(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED2(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED3(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED4(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED5(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`,`*`val5`*`)`

`ASSERT_PRED1(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED2(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED3(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED4(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED5(`*`pred`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`,`*`val5`*`)`

Verifies that the predicate *`pred`* returns `true` when passed the given values
as arguments.

The parameter *`pred`* is a function or functor that accepts as many arguments
as the corresponding macro accepts values. If *`pred`* returns `true` for the
given arguments, the assertion succeeds, otherwise the assertion fails.

When the assertion fails, it prints the value of each argument. Arguments are
always evaluated exactly once.

As an example, see the following code:

```cpp
// Returns true if m and n have no common divisors except 1.
bool MutuallyPrime(int m, int n) { ... }
...
const int a = 3;
const int b = 4;
const int c = 10;
...
EXPECT_PRED2(MutuallyPrime, a, b);  // Succeeds
EXPECT_PRED2(MutuallyPrime, b, c);  // Fails
```

In the above example, the first assertion succeeds, and the second fails with
the following message:

```
MutuallyPrime(b, c) is false, where
b is 4
c is 10
```

Note that if the given predicate is an overloaded function or a function
template, the assertion macro might not be able to determine which version to
use, and it might be necessary to explicitly specify the type of the function.
For example, for a Boolean function `IsPositive()` overloaded to take either a
single `int` or `double` argument, it would be necessary to write one of the
following:

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED1(static_cast<bool (*)(int)>(IsPositive), 5);
EXPECT_PRED1(static_cast<bool (*)(double)>(IsPositive), 3.14);
```

Writing simply `EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, 5);` would result in a compiler error.
Similarly, to use a template function, specify the template arguments:

```cpp
template <typename T>
bool IsNegative(T x) {
  return x < 0;
}
...
EXPECT_PRED1(IsNegative<int>, -5);  // Must specify type for IsNegative
```

If a template has multiple parameters, wrap the predicate in parentheses so the
macro arguments are parsed correctly:

```cpp
ASSERT_PRED2((MyPredicate<int, int>), 5, 0);
```

### EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT* {#EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT}

`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT3(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`)` \
`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT4(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`)`
\
`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT5(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`,`*`val5`*`)`

`ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT1(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT2(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT3(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`)` \
`ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT4(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`)`
\
`ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT5(`*`pred_formatter`*`,`*`val1`*`,`*`val2`*`,`*`val3`*`,`*`val4`*`,`*`val5`*`)`

Verifies that the predicate *`pred_formatter`* succeeds when passed the given
values as arguments.

The parameter *`pred_formatter`* is a *predicate-formatter*, which is a function
or functor with the signature:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult PredicateFormatter(const char* expr1,
                                            const char* expr2,
                                            ...
                                            const char* exprn,
                                            T1 val1,
                                            T2 val2,
                                            ...
                                            Tn valn);
```

where *`val1`*, *`val2`*, ..., *`valn`* are the values of the predicate
arguments, and *`expr1`*, *`expr2`*, ..., *`exprn`* are the corresponding
expressions as they appear in the source code. The types `T1`, `T2`, ..., `Tn`
can be either value types or reference types; if an argument has type `T`, it
can be declared as either `T` or `const T&`, whichever is appropriate. For more
about the return type `testing::AssertionResult`, see
[Using a Function That Returns an AssertionResult](../advanced.md#using-a-function-that-returns-an-assertionresult).

As an example, see the following code:

```cpp
// Returns the smallest prime common divisor of m and n,
// or 1 when m and n are mutually prime.
int SmallestPrimeCommonDivisor(int m, int n) { ... }

// Returns true if m and n have no common divisors except 1.
bool MutuallyPrime(int m, int n) { ... }

// A predicate-formatter for asserting that two integers are mutually prime.
testing::AssertionResult AssertMutuallyPrime(const char* m_expr,
                                             const char* n_expr,
                                             int m,
                                             int n) {
  if (MutuallyPrime(m, n)) return testing::AssertionSuccess();

  return testing::AssertionFailure() << m_expr << " and " << n_expr
      << " (" << m << " and " << n << ") are not mutually prime, "
      << "as they have a common divisor " << SmallestPrimeCommonDivisor(m, n);
}

...
const int a = 3;
const int b = 4;
const int c = 10;
...
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, a, b);  // Succeeds
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, b, c);  // Fails
```

In the above example, the final assertion fails and the predicate-formatter
produces the following failure message:

```
b and c (4 and 10) are not mutually prime, as they have a common divisor 2
```

## Windows HRESULT Assertions {#HRESULT}

The following assertions test for `HRESULT` success or failure. For example:

```cpp
CComPtr<IShellDispatch2> shell;
ASSERT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(shell.CoCreateInstance(L"Shell.Application"));
CComVariant empty;
ASSERT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(shell->ShellExecute(CComBSTR(url), empty, empty, empty, empty));
```

The generated output contains the human-readable error message associated with
the returned `HRESULT` code.

### EXPECT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED {#EXPECT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED}

`EXPECT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(`*`expression`*`)` \
`ASSERT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(`*`expression`*`)`

Verifies that *`expression`* is a success `HRESULT`.

### EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED {#EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED}

`EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED(`*`expression`*`)` \
`EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED(`*`expression`*`)`

Verifies that *`expression`* is a failure `HRESULT`.

## Death Assertions {#death}

The following assertions verify that a piece of code causes the process to
terminate. For context, see [Death Tests](../advanced.md#death-tests).

These assertions spawn a new process and execute the code under test in that
process. How that happens depends on the platform and the variable
`::testing::GTEST_FLAG(death_test_style)`, which is initialized from the
command-line flag `--gtest_death_test_style`.

*   On POSIX systems, `fork()` (or `clone()` on Linux) is used to spawn the
    child, after which:
    *   If the variable's value is `"fast"`, the death test statement is
        immediately executed.
    *   If the variable's value is `"threadsafe"`, the child process re-executes
        the unit test binary just as it was originally invoked, but with some
        extra flags to cause just the single death test under consideration to
        be run.
*   On Windows, the child is spawned using the `CreateProcess()` API, and
    re-executes the binary to cause just the single death test under
    consideration to be run - much like the `"threadsafe"` mode on POSIX.

Other values for the variable are illegal and will cause the death test to fail.
Currently, the flag's default value is
**`"fast"`**.

If the death test statement runs to completion without dying, the child process
will nonetheless terminate, and the assertion fails.

Note that the piece of code under test can be a compound statement, for example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({
  int n = 5;
  DoSomething(&n);
}, "Error on line .* of DoSomething()");
```

### EXPECT_DEATH {#EXPECT_DEATH}

`EXPECT_DEATH(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)` \
`ASSERT_DEATH(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)`

Verifies that *`statement`* causes the process to terminate with a nonzero exit
status and produces `stderr` output that matches *`matcher`*.

The parameter *`matcher`* is either a [matcher](matchers.md) for a `const
std::string&`, or a regular expression (see
[Regular Expression Syntax](../advanced.md#regular-expression-syntax))—a bare
string *`s`* (with no matcher) is treated as
[`ContainsRegex(s)`](matchers.md#string-matchers), **not**
[`Eq(s)`](matchers.md#generic-comparison).

For example, the following code verifies that calling `DoSomething(42)` causes
the process to die with an error message that contains the text `My error`:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(DoSomething(42), "My error");
```

### EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED {#EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED}

`EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)` \
`ASSERT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)`

If death tests are supported, behaves the same as
[`EXPECT_DEATH`](#EXPECT_DEATH). Otherwise, verifies nothing.

### EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH {#EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH}

`EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)` \
`ASSERT_DEBUG_DEATH(`*`statement`*`,`*`matcher`*`)`

In debug mode, behaves the same as [`EXPECT_DEATH`](#EXPECT_DEATH). When not in
debug mode (i.e. `NDEBUG` is defined), just executes *`statement`*.

### EXPECT_EXIT {#EXPECT_EXIT}

`EXPECT_EXIT(`*`statement`*`,`*`predicate`*`,`*`matcher`*`)` \
`ASSERT_EXIT(`*`statement`*`,`*`predicate`*`,`*`matcher`*`)`

Verifies that *`statement`* causes the process to terminate with an exit status
that satisfies *`predicate`*, and produces `stderr` output that matches
*`matcher`*.

The parameter *`predicate`* is a function or functor that accepts an `int` exit
status and returns a `bool`. GoogleTest provides two predicates to handle common
cases:

```cpp
// Returns true if the program exited normally with the given exit status code.
::testing::ExitedWithCode(exit_code);

// Returns true if the program was killed by the given signal.
// Not available on Windows.
::testing::KilledBySignal(signal_number);
```

The parameter *`matcher`* is either a [matcher](matchers.md) for a `const
std::string&`, or a regular expression (see
[Regular Expression Syntax](../advanced.md#regular-expression-syntax))—a bare
string *`s`* (with no matcher) is treated as
[`ContainsRegex(s)`](matchers.md#string-matchers), **not**
[`Eq(s)`](matchers.md#generic-comparison).

For example, the following code verifies that calling `NormalExit()` causes the
process to print a message containing the text `Success` to `stderr` and exit
with exit status code 0:

```cpp
EXPECT_EXIT(NormalExit(), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "Success");
```

# Mocking Reference

This page lists the facilities provided by GoogleTest for creating and working
with mock objects. To use them, include the header
`gmock/gmock.h`.

## Macros {#macros}

GoogleTest defines the following macros for working with mocks.

### MOCK_METHOD {#MOCK_METHOD}

`MOCK_METHOD(`*`return_type`*`,`*`method_name`*`, (`*`args...`*`));` \
`MOCK_METHOD(`*`return_type`*`,`*`method_name`*`, (`*`args...`*`),
(`*`specs...`*`));`

Defines a mock method *`method_name`* with arguments `(`*`args...`*`)` and
return type *`return_type`* within a mock class.

The parameters of `MOCK_METHOD` mirror the method declaration. The optional
fourth parameter *`specs...`* is a comma-separated list of qualifiers. The
following qualifiers are accepted:

| Qualifier                  | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `const`                    | Makes the mocked method a `const` method. Required if overriding a `const` method. |
| `override`                 | Marks the method with `override`. Recommended if overriding a `virtual` method. |
| `noexcept`                 | Marks the method with `noexcept`. Required if overriding a `noexcept` method. |
| `Calltype(`*`calltype`*`)` | Sets the call type for the method, for example `Calltype(STDMETHODCALLTYPE)`. Useful on Windows. |
| `ref(`*`qualifier`*`)`     | Marks the method with the given reference qualifier, for example `ref(&)` or `ref(&&)`. Required if overriding a method that has a reference qualifier. |

Note that commas in arguments prevent `MOCK_METHOD` from parsing the arguments
correctly if they are not appropriately surrounded by parentheses. See the
following example:

```cpp
class MyMock {
 public:
  // The following 2 lines will not compile due to commas in the arguments:
  MOCK_METHOD(std::pair<bool, int>, GetPair, ());              // Error!
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, (std::map<int, double>, bool));  // Error!

  // One solution - wrap arguments that contain commas in parentheses:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));

  // Another solution - use type aliases:
  using BoolAndInt = std::pair<bool, int>;
  MOCK_METHOD(BoolAndInt, GetPair, ());
  using MapIntDouble = std::map<int, double>;
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, (MapIntDouble, bool));
};
```

`MOCK_METHOD` must be used in the `public:` section of a mock class definition,
regardless of whether the method being mocked is `public`, `protected`, or
`private` in the base class.

### EXPECT_CALL {#EXPECT_CALL}

`EXPECT_CALL(`*`mock_object`*`,`*`method_name`*`(`*`matchers...`*`))`

Creates an [expectation](../gmock_for_dummies.md#setting-expectations) that the
method *`method_name`* of the object *`mock_object`* is called with arguments
that match the given matchers *`matchers...`*. `EXPECT_CALL` must precede any
code that exercises the mock object.

The parameter *`matchers...`* is a comma-separated list of
[matchers](../gmock_for_dummies.md#matchers-what-arguments-do-we-expect) that
correspond to each argument of the method *`method_name`*. The expectation will
apply only to calls of *`method_name`* whose arguments match all of the
matchers. If `(`*`matchers...`*`)` is omitted, the expectation behaves as if
each argument's matcher were a [wildcard matcher (`_`)](matchers.md#wildcard).
See the [Matchers Reference](matchers.md) for a list of all built-in matchers.

The following chainable clauses can be used to modify the expectation, and they
must be used in the following order:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, method_name(matchers...))
    .With(multi_argument_matcher)  // Can be used at most once
    .Times(cardinality)            // Can be used at most once
    .InSequence(sequences...)      // Can be used any number of times
    .After(expectations...)        // Can be used any number of times
    .WillOnce(action)              // Can be used any number of times
    .WillRepeatedly(action)        // Can be used at most once
    .RetiresOnSaturation();        // Can be used at most once
```

See details for each modifier clause below.

#### With {#EXPECT_CALL.With}

`.With(`*`multi_argument_matcher`*`)`

Restricts the expectation to apply only to mock function calls whose arguments
as a whole match the multi-argument matcher *`multi_argument_matcher`*.

GoogleTest passes all of the arguments as one tuple into the matcher. The
parameter *`multi_argument_matcher`* must thus be a matcher of type
`Matcher<std::tuple<A1, ..., An>>`, where `A1, ..., An` are the types of the
function arguments.

For example, the following code sets the expectation that
`my_mock.SetPosition()` is called with any two arguments, the first argument
being less than the second:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Lt;
...
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());
```

GoogleTest provides some built-in matchers for 2-tuples, including the `Lt()`
matcher above. See [Multi-argument Matchers](matchers.md#MultiArgMatchers).

The `With` clause can be used at most once on an expectation and must be the
first clause.

#### Times {#EXPECT_CALL.Times}

`.Times(`*`cardinality`*`)`

Specifies how many times the mock function call is expected.

The parameter *`cardinality`* represents the number of expected calls and can be
one of the following, all defined in the `::testing` namespace:

| Cardinality         | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `AnyNumber()`       | The function can be called any number of times.     |
| `AtLeast(n)`        | The function call is expected at least *n* times.   |
| `AtMost(n)`         | The function call is expected at most *n* times.    |
| `Between(m, n)`     | The function call is expected between *m* and *n* times, inclusive. |
| `Exactly(n)` or `n` | The function call is expected exactly *n* times. If *n* is 0, the call should never happen. |

If the `Times` clause is omitted, GoogleTest infers the cardinality as follows:

*   If neither [`WillOnce`](#EXPECT_CALL.WillOnce) nor
    [`WillRepeatedly`](#EXPECT_CALL.WillRepeatedly) are specified, the inferred
    cardinality is `Times(1)`.
*   If there are *n* `WillOnce` clauses and no `WillRepeatedly` clause, where
    *n* >= 1, the inferred cardinality is `Times(n)`.
*   If there are *n* `WillOnce` clauses and one `WillRepeatedly` clause, where
    *n* >= 0, the inferred cardinality is `Times(AtLeast(n))`.

The `Times` clause can be used at most once on an expectation.

#### InSequence {#EXPECT_CALL.InSequence}

`.InSequence(`*`sequences...`*`)`

Specifies that the mock function call is expected in a certain sequence.

The parameter *`sequences...`* is any number of [`Sequence`](#Sequence) objects.
Expected calls assigned to the same sequence are expected to occur in the order
the expectations are declared.

For example, the following code sets the expectation that the `Reset()` method
of `my_mock` is called before both `GetSize()` and `Describe()`, and `GetSize()`
and `Describe()` can occur in any order relative to each other:

```cpp
using ::testing::Sequence;
Sequence s1, s2;
...
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, Reset())
    .InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, GetSize())
    .InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, Describe())
    .InSequence(s2);
```

The `InSequence` clause can be used any number of times on an expectation.

See also the [`InSequence` class](#InSequence).

#### After {#EXPECT_CALL.After}

`.After(`*`expectations...`*`)`

Specifies that the mock function call is expected to occur after one or more
other calls.

The parameter *`expectations...`* can be up to five
[`Expectation`](#Expectation) or [`ExpectationSet`](#ExpectationSet) objects.
The mock function call is expected to occur after all of the given expectations.

For example, the following code sets the expectation that the `Describe()`
method of `my_mock` is called only after both `InitX()` and `InitY()` have been
called.

```cpp
using ::testing::Expectation;
...
Expectation init_x = EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, InitX());
Expectation init_y = EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, InitY());
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, Describe())
    .After(init_x, init_y);
```

The `ExpectationSet` object is helpful when the number of prerequisites for an
expectation is large or variable, for example:

```cpp
using ::testing::ExpectationSet;
...
ExpectationSet all_inits;
// Collect all expectations of InitElement() calls
for (int i = 0; i < element_count; i++) {
  all_inits += EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, InitElement(i));
}
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, Describe())
    .After(all_inits);  // Expect Describe() call after all InitElement() calls
```

The `After` clause can be used any number of times on an expectation.

#### WillOnce {#EXPECT_CALL.WillOnce}

`.WillOnce(`*`action`*`)`

Specifies the mock function's actual behavior when invoked, for a single
matching function call.

The parameter *`action`* represents the
[action](../gmock_for_dummies.md#actions-what-should-it-do) that the function
call will perform. See the [Actions Reference](actions.md) for a list of
built-in actions.

The use of `WillOnce` implicitly sets a cardinality on the expectation when
`Times` is not specified. See [`Times`](#EXPECT_CALL.Times).

Each matching function call will perform the next action in the order declared.
For example, the following code specifies that `my_mock.GetNumber()` is expected
to be called exactly 3 times and will return `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively on
the first, second, and third calls:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
...
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, GetNumber())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillOnce(Return(3));
```

The `WillOnce` clause can be used any number of times on an expectation. Unlike
`WillRepeatedly`, the action fed to each `WillOnce` call will be called at most
once, so may be a move-only type and/or have an `&&`-qualified call operator.

#### WillRepeatedly {#EXPECT_CALL.WillRepeatedly}

`.WillRepeatedly(`*`action`*`)`

Specifies the mock function's actual behavior when invoked, for all subsequent
matching function calls. Takes effect after the actions specified in the
[`WillOnce`](#EXPECT_CALL.WillOnce) clauses, if any, have been performed.

The parameter *`action`* represents the
[action](../gmock_for_dummies.md#actions-what-should-it-do) that the function
call will perform. See the [Actions Reference](actions.md) for a list of
built-in actions.

The use of `WillRepeatedly` implicitly sets a cardinality on the expectation
when `Times` is not specified. See [`Times`](#EXPECT_CALL.Times).

If any `WillOnce` clauses have been specified, matching function calls will
perform those actions before the action specified by `WillRepeatedly`. See the
following example:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
...
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, GetName())
    .WillRepeatedly(Return("John Doe"));  // Return "John Doe" on all calls

EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, GetNumber())
    .WillOnce(Return(42))        // Return 42 on the first call
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(7));  // Return 7 on all subsequent calls
```

The `WillRepeatedly` clause can be used at most once on an expectation.

#### RetiresOnSaturation {#EXPECT_CALL.RetiresOnSaturation}

`.RetiresOnSaturation()`

Indicates that the expectation will no longer be active after the expected
number of matching function calls has been reached.

The `RetiresOnSaturation` clause is only meaningful for expectations with an
upper-bounded cardinality. The expectation will *retire* (no longer match any
function calls) after it has been *saturated* (the upper bound has been
reached). See the following example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::AnyNumber;
...
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, SetNumber(_))  // Expectation 1
    .Times(AnyNumber());
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, SetNumber(7))  // Expectation 2
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

In the above example, the first two calls to `my_mock.SetNumber(7)` match
expectation 2, which then becomes inactive and no longer matches any calls. A
third call to `my_mock.SetNumber(7)` would then match expectation 1. Without
`RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectation 2, a third call to `my_mock.SetNumber(7)`
would match expectation 2 again, producing a failure since the limit of 2 calls
was exceeded.

The `RetiresOnSaturation` clause can be used at most once on an expectation and
must be the last clause.

### ON_CALL {#ON_CALL}

`ON_CALL(`*`mock_object`*`,`*`method_name`*`(`*`matchers...`*`))`

Defines what happens when the method *`method_name`* of the object
*`mock_object`* is called with arguments that match the given matchers
*`matchers...`*. Requires a modifier clause to specify the method's behavior.
*Does not* set any expectations that the method will be called.

The parameter *`matchers...`* is a comma-separated list of
[matchers](../gmock_for_dummies.md#matchers-what-arguments-do-we-expect) that
correspond to each argument of the method *`method_name`*. The `ON_CALL`
specification will apply only to calls of *`method_name`* whose arguments match
all of the matchers. If `(`*`matchers...`*`)` is omitted, the behavior is as if
each argument's matcher were a [wildcard matcher (`_`)](matchers.md#wildcard).
See the [Matchers Reference](matchers.md) for a list of all built-in matchers.

The following chainable clauses can be used to set the method's behavior, and
they must be used in the following order:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_object, method_name(matchers...))
    .With(multi_argument_matcher)  // Can be used at most once
    .WillByDefault(action);        // Required
```

See details for each modifier clause below.

#### With {#ON_CALL.With}

`.With(`*`multi_argument_matcher`*`)`

Restricts the specification to only mock function calls whose arguments as a
whole match the multi-argument matcher *`multi_argument_matcher`*.

GoogleTest passes all of the arguments as one tuple into the matcher. The
parameter *`multi_argument_matcher`* must thus be a matcher of type
`Matcher<std::tuple<A1, ..., An>>`, where `A1, ..., An` are the types of the
function arguments.

For example, the following code sets the default behavior when
`my_mock.SetPosition()` is called with any two arguments, the first argument
being less than the second:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Lt;
using ::testing::Return;
...
ON_CALL(my_mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt())
    .WillByDefault(Return(true));
```

GoogleTest provides some built-in matchers for 2-tuples, including the `Lt()`
matcher above. See [Multi-argument Matchers](matchers.md#MultiArgMatchers).

The `With` clause can be used at most once with each `ON_CALL` statement.

#### WillByDefault {#ON_CALL.WillByDefault}

`.WillByDefault(`*`action`*`)`

Specifies the default behavior of a matching mock function call.

The parameter *`action`* represents the
[action](../gmock_for_dummies.md#actions-what-should-it-do) that the function
call will perform. See the [Actions Reference](actions.md) for a list of
built-in actions.

For example, the following code specifies that by default, a call to
`my_mock.Greet()` will return `"hello"`:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
...
ON_CALL(my_mock, Greet())
    .WillByDefault(Return("hello"));
```

The action specified by `WillByDefault` is superseded by the actions specified
on a matching `EXPECT_CALL` statement, if any. See the
[`WillOnce`](#EXPECT_CALL.WillOnce) and
[`WillRepeatedly`](#EXPECT_CALL.WillRepeatedly) clauses of `EXPECT_CALL`.

The `WillByDefault` clause must be used exactly once with each `ON_CALL`
statement.

## Classes {#classes}

GoogleTest defines the following classes for working with mocks.

### DefaultValue {#DefaultValue}

`::testing::DefaultValue<T>`

Allows a user to specify the default value for a type `T` that is both copyable
and publicly destructible (i.e. anything that can be used as a function return
type). For mock functions with a return type of `T`, this default value is
returned from function calls that do not specify an action.

Provides the static methods `Set()`, `SetFactory()`, and `Clear()` to manage the
default value:

```cpp
// Sets the default value to be returned. T must be copy constructible.
DefaultValue<T>::Set(value);

// Sets a factory. Will be invoked on demand. T must be move constructible.
T MakeT();
DefaultValue<T>::SetFactory(&MakeT);

// Unsets the default value.
DefaultValue<T>::Clear();
```

### NiceMock {#NiceMock}

`::testing::NiceMock<T>`

Represents a mock object that suppresses warnings on
[uninteresting calls](../gmock_cook_book.md#uninteresting-vs-unexpected). The
template parameter `T` is any mock class, except for another `NiceMock`,
`NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`.

Usage of `NiceMock<T>` is analogous to usage of `T`. `NiceMock<T>` is a subclass
of `T`, so it can be used wherever an object of type `T` is accepted. In
addition, `NiceMock<T>` can be constructed with any arguments that a constructor
of `T` accepts.

For example, the following code suppresses warnings on the mock `my_mock` of
type `MockClass` if a method other than `DoSomething()` is called:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
...
NiceMock<MockClass> my_mock("some", "args");
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, DoSomething());
... code that uses my_mock ...
```

`NiceMock<T>` only works for mock methods defined using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro
directly in the definition of class `T`. If a mock method is defined in a base
class of `T`, a warning might still be generated.

`NiceMock<T>` might not work correctly if the destructor of `T` is not virtual.

### NaggyMock {#NaggyMock}

`::testing::NaggyMock<T>`

Represents a mock object that generates warnings on
[uninteresting calls](../gmock_cook_book.md#uninteresting-vs-unexpected). The
template parameter `T` is any mock class, except for another `NiceMock`,
`NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`.

Usage of `NaggyMock<T>` is analogous to usage of `T`. `NaggyMock<T>` is a
subclass of `T`, so it can be used wherever an object of type `T` is accepted.
In addition, `NaggyMock<T>` can be constructed with any arguments that a
constructor of `T` accepts.

For example, the following code generates warnings on the mock `my_mock` of type
`MockClass` if a method other than `DoSomething()` is called:

```cpp
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
...
NaggyMock<MockClass> my_mock("some", "args");
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, DoSomething());
... code that uses my_mock ...
```

Mock objects of type `T` by default behave the same way as `NaggyMock<T>`.

### StrictMock {#StrictMock}

`::testing::StrictMock<T>`

Represents a mock object that generates test failures on
[uninteresting calls](../gmock_cook_book.md#uninteresting-vs-unexpected). The
template parameter `T` is any mock class, except for another `NiceMock`,
`NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`.

Usage of `StrictMock<T>` is analogous to usage of `T`. `StrictMock<T>` is a
subclass of `T`, so it can be used wherever an object of type `T` is accepted.
In addition, `StrictMock<T>` can be constructed with any arguments that a
constructor of `T` accepts.

For example, the following code generates a test failure on the mock `my_mock`
of type `MockClass` if a method other than `DoSomething()` is called:

```cpp
using ::testing::StrictMock;
...
StrictMock<MockClass> my_mock("some", "args");
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, DoSomething());
... code that uses my_mock ...
```

`StrictMock<T>` only works for mock methods defined using the `MOCK_METHOD`
macro directly in the definition of class `T`. If a mock method is defined in a
base class of `T`, a failure might not be generated.

`StrictMock<T>` might not work correctly if the destructor of `T` is not
virtual.

### Sequence {#Sequence}

`::testing::Sequence`

Represents a chronological sequence of expectations. See the
[`InSequence`](#EXPECT_CALL.InSequence) clause of `EXPECT_CALL` for usage.

### InSequence {#InSequence}

`::testing::InSequence`

An object of this type causes all expectations encountered in its scope to be
put in an anonymous sequence.

This allows more convenient expression of multiple expectations in a single
sequence:

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence seq;

  // The following are expected to occur in the order declared.
  EXPECT_CALL(...);
  EXPECT_CALL(...);
  ...
  EXPECT_CALL(...);
}
```

The name of the `InSequence` object does not matter.

### Expectation {#Expectation}

`::testing::Expectation`

Represents a mock function call expectation as created by
[`EXPECT_CALL`](#EXPECT_CALL):

```cpp
using ::testing::Expectation;
Expectation my_expectation = EXPECT_CALL(...);
```

Useful for specifying sequences of expectations; see the
[`After`](#EXPECT_CALL.After) clause of `EXPECT_CALL`.

### ExpectationSet {#ExpectationSet}

`::testing::ExpectationSet`

Represents a set of mock function call expectations.

Use the `+=` operator to add [`Expectation`](#Expectation) objects to the set:

```cpp
using ::testing::ExpectationSet;
ExpectationSet my_expectations;
my_expectations += EXPECT_CALL(...);
```

Useful for specifying sequences of expectations; see the
[`After`](#EXPECT_CALL.After) clause of `EXPECT_CALL`.
